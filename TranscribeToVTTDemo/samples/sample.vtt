00:00:00.074 --> 00:00:03.574
The white house is suspending cnn chief white house correspondent jim acosta's press

00:00:03.574 --> 00:00:07.254
pass until further notice. The word came down hours after a cost to ask the president

00:00:07.254 --> 00:00:11.264
questions at the news conference this afternoon. Jim joins us now, so takes through

00:00:11.274 --> 00:00:15.274
what's going on. Yeah, I went back to the white house, actually do ah, live shot

00:00:15.274 --> 00:00:19.594
for your program just before eight o'clock and when I arrived at the gate, he secret

00:00:19.594 --> 00:00:24.504
service came out and inform me that my press credentials were being I

00:00:24.514 --> 00:00:29.404
guess revoked, temporarily suspended, and the secret service officer came over to

00:00:29.404 --> 00:00:34.244
me and asked me to hand over my credential. And I did, and I told him I said, listen,

00:00:34.244 --> 00:00:38.014
I know you're a professional. You're just doing your job. Oh, and thanks for your

00:00:38.014 --> 00:00:42.764
service and handed in my credential I've had for five years. I want to read

00:00:42.774 --> 00:00:47.304
reaction from a few your colleagues covering the white house. Jeff mason from reuters

00:00:47.304 --> 00:00:51.444
has tweeted. I was seated next to acosta today's press conference and did not witness

00:00:51.444 --> 00:00:55.984
am placing his hands. That's in quotes on. The young intern in the white house alleges

00:00:55.984 --> 00:00:59.654
he held onto the microphone as she reached for him. Peter baker from the new york

00:00:59.654 --> 00:01:03.434
times. Tweeted. False predicated to punish a reporter. This is what the president

00:01:03.434 --> 00:01:07.714
wants. If he really thought at acosta was unfair, then why did he call in him? Because

00:01:07.714 --> 00:01:11.744
he wants the confrontation. Maggie haberman tweeting acosta, who? The white house's

00:01:11.744 --> 00:01:16.534
alleging quote placed his hands on the young intern said quote, pardon me, ma'am,

00:01:16.734 --> 00:01:21.384
as he tried to ask his question. Also want to read a statement that cnn's just

00:01:21.384 --> 00:01:24.884
released? The statement reads. The white house announced tonight that it has revoked

00:01:24.894 --> 00:01:28.634
the press pass of cnn chief white house correspondent jim acosta. It was done in

00:01:28.634 --> 00:01:33.144
retaliation for his challenging questions at today's press conference. In the explanation,

00:01:33.144 --> 00:01:37.754
press secretary sarah sanders lied. She provided fraudulent accusations, incited

00:01:37.754 --> 00:01:42.454
an incident that never happened. This unprecedented decision is a threat to our democracy,

00:01:42.454 --> 00:01:46.384
and the country deserves better. Jim acosta has our full support.

00:01:47.574 --> 00:01:50.944
Anything else? Well, I was, you know, I was just trying to ask a question of the

00:01:50.944 --> 00:01:54.074
president at this press conference, and it was obviously a question they didn't like.

00:01:54.074 --> 00:01:58.784
It was about his racist ad on the caravan that they were running before the midterms.

00:01:59.174 --> 00:02:02.718
Hey, and I, we're going back and fourth there, and as you can see in this video,

00:02:03.158 --> 00:02:06.368
this in turn came up to me. I think they're describing her as an intern. I don't

00:02:06.378 --> 00:02:11.128
really know who she is and attempted to take the micro phone away from me. All I

00:02:11.128 --> 00:02:14.178
can say at that point is that I was trying to hang on to the microphone so I could

00:02:14.178 --> 00:02:19.178
continue to ask the president questions. Obviously, you know, I didn't put

00:02:19.178 --> 00:02:23.368
my hands on her or touch her as they're alleging. And it's just unfortunate that

00:02:23.378 --> 00:02:27.268
the white house is saying this. You know, we all try to be professionals over there,

00:02:27.268 --> 00:02:31.088
and I think I handled myself professionally, and I appreciate all of the comments

00:02:31.088 --> 00:02:35.758
from my colleagues. I do think, anderson, that this is a test for all of us.

00:02:35.768 --> 00:02:40.738
I do think they're tryingto shut us down to some extent inside

00:02:40.738 --> 00:02:43.738
the white house press corps. And to some extent, I think they're trying to send a

00:02:43.738 --> 00:02:48.088
message to our colleagues and you had no advance warning this. This was simply when

00:02:48.088 --> 00:02:51.708
you got to the white house to go do a live shot. You were just informed by secret

00:02:51.708 --> 00:02:56.398
service. Yeah, I saw the statement on my phone from sarah sanders that my press

00:02:56.398 --> 00:02:59.158
credentials were being revoked. I thought, well, maybe I'll get inside the white

00:02:59.158 --> 00:03:03.838
house for one more live shot on your show. And at that point, I was simply

00:03:03.838 --> 00:03:08.048
blocked from entering the entering the facility. As matter of fact, there was an

00:03:08.048 --> 00:03:12.468
officer who stood in front of the doorway to the security booth that I've gone through

00:03:12.468 --> 00:03:15.428
every day for the last year, every working day that come to the white house for the

00:03:15.428 --> 00:03:19.748
last five years. So it was a pretty surreal experience. I never thought in this country

00:03:19.748 --> 00:03:23.818
that I wouldn't be able to go and cover the president united states simply because

00:03:23.818 --> 00:03:28.168
I was trying to ask a question. Jim acosta. Um, little stand and we'll see what happens

00:03:28.218 --> 00:03:29.238
very much appreciated.
